**Project Setup**

git clone [https://github.com/kkwillijr/CottonDetection.git]

(or I recommend installing Github Desktop, its alot easier)

**Model Layout**

**Preprocessing**

-convertes the images to grayscale

-applies a Gaussian filter to smooth the images out

-resize images to a standard dimension (256x256 pixels)

**Feature Extraction**

**Edge Detection:** : Use the Canny method to detect edges

**Color Histograms** :Compute histograms for the grayscale values

**Image Segmentation** : Apply Otsu's thresholding method to segment the images

**Classification**
Uses the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm to classify the images based on the extracted features above.
Determine the optimal number of neighbors (K) through cross-validation.

**Evaluation and Metrics**
The model's performance is evaluated on a test set, not seen during the training phase.
Metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score are calculated to assess the effectiveness of the model

Confusion Matric

A confusion matrix is also generated. We use this to evaulate the prediction with the actual results from the dataset.
 
**Evaluation of Performance**
 While the developed system is faster and boasts a passable and high accuracy rate of 78%, manual diagnosis is still  more accurate. This is because the developed system relies on preset teachings, whereas manual diagnosis, while considerably  slower, tends to have a higher accuracy through human judgment.
